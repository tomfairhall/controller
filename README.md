# System Controller v0.1.x

Todo:
- Add stable and dev software switching buttons
- Add logging period changing function
- Add initialising script
- Update camera controls to modern
- Dynamic tiles
- Cron job integrity (adds job if doesn't exist - related to init script?)
- LED server display
- How to control when there is no System View image?
- Fix paths to not be hardcoded
- Make sure graphs have gaps when nothing is being recorded
- Unify display functions

Ideas:
- Set up RPI as access point so that wifi switches can connect to it
- Add alarming system (e.g., if light is on longer than expected -> send alarm)
